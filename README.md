👋 **Hi, I'm Maxime Vidori**

 a software/infrastructure engineer and consultant with deep expertise across the entire software lifecycle—from development 🛠️ and CI/CD pipelines 🔄 to production environments 🚀 and incident management 🔧.

I specialize in helping companies navigate and implement the Kubernetes ecosystem, whether you're working with cloud-native platforms ☁️ or operating on bare metal 🖥️. My goal is to make sure your systems are production-ready, scalable, and secure.

I’m here to provide practical solutions that drive efficiency and reliability in your software delivery process.

Got questions or challenges? I provide a casual "Architecture/Infrastructure Coffee Chat" ☕ (check my [calendly][calendly_link]) —a space to discuss your architecture, infrastructure, or Kubernetes-related ideas. 

📧 If you have a question, need some guidance or consulting, send me an email at maxime.vidori@gmail.com

Feel free to reach out and let’s have a chat!
